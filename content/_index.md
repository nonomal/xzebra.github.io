I'm a Software Engineer with a special interest in the Apple ecosystem. Cybersecurity enthusiast. I love automating stuff and in my
free time I create applications and tools. Currently working at {{< highlighted-link color="#004bbf" url="https://hiberus.com/en" >}}Hiberus{{< /highlighted-link >}} as an iOS Developer.

I started learning to code at a young age by modding videogames, until I took it more seriously with competitive programming (and
made it to the national final). I've also participated in many hackathons. I studied Software Engineering at the {{< highlighted-link color="#47aeff" url="https://eina.unizar.es/en/welcome" >}}University of Zaragoza{{< /highlighted-link >}}.

I like to play videogames. I'm also quite active, always trying new hobbies
and find interesting studying new fields.
