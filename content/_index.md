I'm a Software Engineering student at the {{< highlighted-link color="#47aeff" url="https://eina.unizar.es/en/welcome" >}}University of Zaragoza{{< /highlighted-link >}} with a special
interest in iOS. Cybersecurity enthusiast. I love automating stuff and in my
free time I create applications and tools.

I started learning code by modding videogames and took it more seriously with
competitive programming (and made it to the national final) and I've
participated in many hackathons.

I like to play videogames. I'm also quite active, always trying new hobbies
and find interesting studying new fields.
