Personal blog deployed as a static page using Notion as a CMS, so I can write posts from anywhere and keep the contents secret.

## Technologies used
- The blog is generated by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).
- The content is retrieved from Notion by [notion-blog](https://github.com/xzebra/notion-blog).
- Encryption of some posts relies on [hugo-encrypt](https://github.com/Izumiko/hugo-encrypt).
- Everything is run automatically in a [Github Action](.github/workflows/deploy.yml).

## How to setup?
You can copy the file structure and the Github Action. You may also get more info about `notion-blog` in order to create the database of articles in Notion.
